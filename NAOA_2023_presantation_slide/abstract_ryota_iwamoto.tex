A asymptotic cone is a cone of a set and is considered about the limit of a sequence in the set. This cone has a lot of useful properties, in addition, a cone itself is often used such as a optimization or a set-relation in the field of convex analysis.

Painlev\'e-Kuratowski Convergence is a notion in topological vector space and implies the convergence of set-valued mapping. Characterizing the definition of asymptotic cone with this convergence, asymptotic cone can be redefined as set-valued mapping.

This presentation gives a relation between asymptotic cones and Painlev\'e-Kuratowski Convergence on convex analysis. The former part explains what asymptotic cones is and what Painlev\'e-Kuratowski Convergence means. The latter part introduces that asymptotic cones can be written as the set-valued mapping indeed.
