# Math Study

This repository is outputs of my studying mathematics, whose style is LaTeX. The main content will be convex analysis or nonlinear optimization. Maybe I push python codes like algorisms and figures used in some explanations.

## LaTeX Coding Environment
I pretended this below article; this title means preparing the best LaTeX environment with VSCode.

[VSCode で最高の LaTeX 環境を作る](https://qiita.com/rainbartown/items/d7718f12d71e688f3573)

To format tex codes automatically on save, in the case that you use Mac, you neet to install ``perl`` and ``latexindent``.

```
brew install perl
brew install latexindent
```

## My Using Books
- Asymptotic Cones and Functions in Optimization and Variational Inequalities (author: Alfred Auslender & Marc Teboulle) 🌟

- Convex Analysis and Nonlinear Optimization (author: J.M.BORWEIN and A.S.LEWIS)

## Note

``cmd + option + j``: you can check where your tex codes is in outputted pdf.

``cmd`` + click in pdf: you find your tex codes for a click point.
