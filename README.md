# Math Study

This repository is outputs of my studying mathematics, whose style is LaTeX. The main content will be convex analysis or nonlinear optimization. Maybe I push python code like figure used in some pdf.

## LaTeX Coding Environment
I pretended this below article; this title means preparing the best LaTeX environment with VSCode.
